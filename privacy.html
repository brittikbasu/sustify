                        <p class="">
                            Data collection  We collect only personally identifiable information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by visitors
                            to this website. Sustify receives limited identifiable information, such as name, Title, company
                            address, email address, and telephone and fax numbers, from website visitors. Typically, identifying
                            information is collected to:</p>
                        <ul class="" style="list-style-type:circle; list-style-position: inside;">
                            <li>Inquire for further information</li>
                            <li>Submit resumes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="">
                            Demographic information, including gender and occupation, is not actively sought, but may be submitted when a visitor responds
                            to an online job application. It is Sustify's policy to limit the information collected to only
                            the minimum information required to complete a visitor's request. In any instance where non-mandatory
                            information is sought, the website visitor will be notified of this at the point of collection.
                            Visitors are also able to send email through the site. Their messages will contain the user's
                            screen name and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include
                            in the message. Because we use the website as a recruiting tool, a visit to the website may also
                            result in the user sending a resume to an individual within Sustify. Sustify's intention is not
                            to seek any sensitive information through our website unless legally required for recruiting
                            purposes. Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating to: race or ethnic
                            origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical
                            or mental health; sexual life or criminal record. We suggest that you do not provide sensitive
                            information of this nature. If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, Sustify
                            accepts your explicit consent to use that information in the ways described in this privacy statement
                            or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information.

                        </p>
                        <h4>Use of data</h4>
                        <p class="">A user may choose to provide personal information in the following examples:

                            <ul class="" style="list-style-type:circle; list-style-position: inside;">
                                <li> Submit resumes or work history information
                                </li>
                                <li>Contact us for further information</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="">
                            If you would like to find out more about the different categories of information collected, please review the data collection
                            section. When a visitor provides personal information to us, we use it in connection with the
                            purposes for which it was provided to us, as stated at the point of collection (or as obvious
                            from the context of collection).  This data is not shared with other entities in the network
                            for secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with a third party other than as described in
                            this statement or otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. If there is an instance where
                            such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for permission beforehand. Sustify
                            makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data. If a visitor
                            believes the site has collected excessive information, we encourage the visitor to contact us
                            at contact@sustify.com to raise any concerns. Sustify will not use personal data collected from
                            our websites to facilitate unsolicited marketing activities.

                        <p class="">
                            It is Sustify's policy only to disclose information to third parties under the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul class="" style="list-style-type:circle; list-style-position: inside;">
                            <li>As required by law through subpoena, search warrant or other legal process
                            </li>
                            <li> When explicitly requested by a visitor
                            </li>
                            <li>When required to deliver publications or reference materials requested by a visitor</li>

                            Sustify websites do not collect or compile personally identifying information for dissemination or sale to outside parties
                            for consumer marketing purposes, or host mailings on behalf of third parties. Personal data collected
                            by Sustify may be transferred or disclosed to third party service providers (and their subcontractors
                            and subsidiaries) who process information on Sustify’s behalf. These service providers, subcontractors
                            and subsidiaries include providers of information technology, identity management, website hosting
                            and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services. They may be located
                            outside the country where a visitor is located. As a result, a visitor’s information may be transferred
                            outside the country where they’re located.

                                There may be links to other websites that do not operate under Sustify.de’s privacy practices. When you follow links to other websites, Sustify's privacy practices no longer apply. We encourage visitors to review each site's privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information.

                                    Contact information about visitors will be kept as long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or until a user requests that we delete that information. Email information is kept for only the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor's requests. Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered dated by our Human Resources departments.

In certain cases in the future, as your Sustify website experience expands, we may require visitors to register in order to obtain a user-id and password for authentication and secure access to a transaction or certain business confidential or proprietary information services on premium websites.
                                        Personally identifiable information provided to Sustify through this website is provided voluntarily by visitors.

                                            Each visitor has the right of access to personal data they have submitted through the websites to Sustify.
                                            User updates of information should be handled by going back through the registration process.

Sustify is committed to providing reasonable and practical access to visitors to allow them the opportunity to identify and correct any inaccuracies. When requested and practical, Sustify will delete identifying information from current operational systems.
                                            When Sustify retains personally identifiable information, Sustify assumes responsibility for keeping an accurate record of the information once a visitor has submitted and verified the data. Sustify does not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personal information. When practically possible, if Sustify is informed that any personal data collected through a website is no longer accurate, Sustify will make appropriate corrections based on the updated information provided by the authenticated visitor.
